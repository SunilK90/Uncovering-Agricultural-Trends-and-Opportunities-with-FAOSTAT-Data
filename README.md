Results and Findings from models-
Linear Regression Models
Baseline Model:
Mean Absolute Error: 3.394417681078034e-09
Mean Squared Error: 1.0107790084728872e-16
R-squared: 1.0
Linear Regression with hyperparameter tuning

Tuned Model Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error: 3.394417681078034e-09
Mean Squared Error: 1.0107790084728872e-16
R-squared: 1.0
Insight: Both the baseline linear regression model and the hyperparameter-tuned model perform exceptionally well with an R-squared of 1.0, indicating a perfect fit.
This is highly unusual and suggests that the data might be extremely linear.

Ridge Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Ridge Regression MSE: 365.43432534456224
Insight: The Ridge Regression model significantly deviates from the perfect scores of the linear models. While it regularizes the coefficients to prevent overfitting, its performance suggests that the 
linear model was already optimal, and that Ridge regression might not be the best choice for this dataset.

Lasso Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Lasso Regression MSE: 8141336.52291233
Insight: The Lasso Regression model performs much worse than Ridge Regression. This indicates that the features in the dataset might not be sparse, or that Lassoâ€™s ability to set some coefficients to zero is not beneficial for this problem.

Random Forest Regression model (with hyperparameter tuning)
Random Forest Regression MSE: 36166277273.16929
Insight: The Random Forest model has a very high MSE, indicating poor performance compared to linear models. This might suggest that the data has a strong linear relationship that tree-based models fail to capture effectively.

Gradient Boosting Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
Gradient Boosting Regression MSE: 57660245667.82349
Insight: Gradient Boosting also shows high MSE, further indicating that boosting methods might not be suitable for this dataset if the underlying relationships are largely linear.

AdaBoost Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
AdaBoost Regression MSE: 1096522517664.4102
Insight: AdaBoost has an even higher MSE than Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, suggesting that boosting weak learners is not effective for this particular problem.

Decision Tree Regressor with hyperparameter tuning
Decision Tree Regression MSE: 58915043854.47922
Insight: The Decision Tree model also shows a very high MSE, indicating overfitting or that it fails to capture the linear relationships in the data.

Linear Relationships:
The linear regression models (both baseline and tuned) have near-perfect performance, suggesting the data has a very strong linear relationship. This also hints that the dataset may be small or overly simplistic.
Regularization:
The Ridge regression, though not as perfect as the linear regression, still performs better than Lasso, suggesting that regularization might be necessary but the data does not benefit from sparsity.
Non-Linear Models:
Tree-based and boosting models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Decision Trees) perform significantly worse, indicating that non-linear relationships or complex interactions are not prominent in the data.

Model Selection:
For this dataset, simpler models like Linear Regression (with or without regularization) are much more effective than complex ensemble methods.

Medium Post: Uncovering Agricultural Trends and Opportunities with FAOSTAT Data
Introduction
Goal of the Analysis:
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify trends and opportunities within the agricultural sector across various countries and crops using the FAOSTAT dataset. 
By examining key agricultural metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes, we aim to uncover potential markets for agribusiness expansion, providing strategic insights for international growth.

FAOSTAT Dataset:
FAOSTAT, maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, offers comprehensive agricultural data from numerous countries. 
This dataset includes a wide array of metrics for various crops and livestock products, making it an invaluable resource for analysing agricultural trends globally.

Data Acquisition and Preparation
Data Collection:
The data was sourced directly from the FAOSTAT database, focusing on relevant agricultural metrics. This dataset encompasses information from different countries and years, offering a broad view of agricultural productivity and trends.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The dataset required several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and usability. 
These steps included handling missing values, filtering relevant columns, and transforming data types. Key metrics such as area harvested, yield, and production volumes were extracted and cleaned for a more focused analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Key Metrics analysed:
The analysis centered on three primary metrics:
Area Harvested: The total area used for cultivating a particular crop.
Yield: The amount of crop produced per unit area.
Production Volumes: The total quantity of crop produced.

Initial Visualizations and Descriptive Statistics:
To understand the data better, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA), which included generating summary statistics and visualizing the distribution of key metrics.
 For instance, we examined the average yield of wheat across different countries to identify significant variations.

Trend Analysis
Methods Used to Analyse Trends:
Trend analysis was performed to identify growth patterns over time. We used statistical methods to analyse changes in yield, area harvested, and production volumes across different countries and crops.

Key Findings:
The analysis revealed several significant trends:
Consistent Growth in Crop Production: Certain countries showed a steady increase in production volumes for key crops, indicating robust agricultural practices and favourable conditions.
Improving Yields: Countries like Afghanistan demonstrated significant improvements in crop yields, particularly for almonds and wheat.
Expansion Opportunities: Countries with expanding agricultural productivity and consistent growth trends were identified as potential markets for agribusiness expansion.
Visualizations:
We created various plots to illustrate these trends. For example, a line chart showing the yield of almonds in Afghanistan over the past decade highlighted a positive growth trend, suggesting a promising market for expansion. 
Afghanistan: Significant improvement in almond yields.
Brazil and China: Steady growth in wheat and rice production.

Recommendations for Agribusiness Expansion:
To focus on expanding into Afghanistan for almonds, and explore opportunities in Brazil and China for wheat and rice.
To establish local partnerships, leverage existing infrastructure, and invest in technology to enhance productivity.

Data Limitations:
The FAOSTAT dataset, while comprehensive, may have gaps or inconsistencies in certain regions or time periods. These limitations could affect the analysis's accuracy.

External Factors:
Political, economic, and environmental factors impacting agriculture were not considered in this analysis, which could influence the trends observed.

Assumptions:
The analysis assumes that observed trends will continue in the future, which may not always be the case due to unforeseen changes in agricultural practices or environmental conditions.
Based on the performance metrics provided for various regression models, we can draw the following insights:
